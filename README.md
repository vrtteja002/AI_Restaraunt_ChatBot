# AI-Powered Restaurant Chatbot 🍽️

An interactive Streamlit application that enables users to analyze restaurant data through natural language conversations, powered by GPT-4 and LangChain.

## Features

- 📊 Upload and analyze restaurant datasets (CSV, PDF, DOCX, TXT)
- 🤖 Natural language interaction with data
- 📈 Automatic data visualization and analysis
- 🌐 Integration with Google Places API
- 💾 Conversation memory
- 📑 Source attribution for responses

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key
- Google Places API key (optional, for external data)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd restaurant-chatbot
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
# Create .streamlit/secrets.toml
OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-openai-key"
GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY = "your-google-places-key"  # Optional
```

### Data Flow
```mermaid

    participant U as User
    participant S as Streamlit UI
    participant D as Document Processor
    participant V as Vector Store
    participant L as LLM Chain
    participant G as GPT-4
    participant M as Memory

    U->>S: Upload Documents
    S->>D: Process Files
    D->>V: Create Embeddings
    U->>S: Ask Question
    S->>L: Forward Query
    L->>V: Retrieve Context
    L->>M: Get Chat History
    L->>G: Generate Response
    G->>S: Stream Response
    S->>U: Display Answer
```

### How It Works

1. **Document Processing**
   - Files uploaded via Streamlit interface
   - Text extraction based on file type (PDF, DOCX, TXT, CSV)
   - Documents split into chunks with overlap
   - Embeddings created using OpenAI

2. **Vector Store**
   - Document chunks stored in Chroma DB
   - Similarity search using MMR for diversity
   - Metadata preserved for source tracking

3. **Query Processing**
   - User questions processed through LangChain
   - Relevant context retrieved from vector store
   - Chat history maintained in memory
   - Context-aware responses generated by GPT-4

4. **External Data Integration**
   - Real-time restaurant data from Google Places
   - Location-based search and filtering
   - Results integrated with local data
